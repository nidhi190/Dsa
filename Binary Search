Given a sorted array of size N and an integer K, find the position at which K is present in the array using binary search.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 5} 
K = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.

solution:

 int binarysearch(int arr[], int n, int k){
       int low=0,high=n-1;
       while(low<=high)
       {
           int mid=(low+high)/2;
           if(arr[mid]==k)
           return mid;
           else if(arr[mid]>k)
           high=mid-1;
           else
           low=mid+1;
       }
       return -1;
    }
