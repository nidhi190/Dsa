Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation: Since its the only 
element hence its the only equilibrium 
point. 

solution:

int equilibriumPoint(long long a[], int n) {
    
    long long leftsum=0,sum=0;
      for(long long i=0;i<n;i++)
      {
          sum+=a[i];
      }
    
      for(long long i=0;i<n;i++)
      {
         sum=sum-a[i];
         if(leftsum==sum)
         return i+1;
         else 
         {
             leftsum+=a[i];
         }
      }
      return -1;
      
    }
